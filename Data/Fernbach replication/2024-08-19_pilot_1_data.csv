Once laws are passed, the government consolidates funding by redirecting current public and private health expenditures into a single, publicly managed fund. This creates a streamlined payment system, which facilitates the restructuring of healthcare delivery by standardizing services and fees across the board. The unified system then implements cost controls through negotiated pricing and bulk purchasing, leading to overall cost savings. These savings allow for expanded coverage and the inclusion of all residents, ensuring universal access. As coverage expands, public health outcomes improve due to broader access to preventive and primary care. The successful transition results in a healthcare system that is equitable, efficient, and sustainable.






",6,In favor,"Raising the retirement age for Social Security begins with a policy decision driven by concerns over the programâ€™s long-term solvency. Once this decision is made, legislation is introduced and passed to gradually increase the retirement age. This legislative change triggers adjustments in the Social Security Administration's benefit calculations, leading to a delayed onset of full benefits for future retirees. As the retirement age rises, the workforce is incentivized to remain employed longer, which increases payroll tax contributions and reduces the number of years benefits are paid out. These factors collectively help extend the financial viability of the Social Security trust fund, mitigating the risk of future shortfalls. The end result is a more sustainable Social Security system, though it may also require addressing potential disparities in life expectancy and work capability among different populations.
